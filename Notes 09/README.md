## Erik Pe√±a
## CIT 114 FALL 2020

1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
   - Reading through the chapter it go into detail on Cloud Architecture and Framework. The explain what is a well architected frame work, and how to make it reliabile and availbile in many different ways.
2. Identify quotes that were made, that you found interesting.
   -  When architecting technologysolutions, if you neglect the five pillars of operational excellence, security, reliability, performanceefficiency, and cost optimization, it can become challenging to build a system that delivers on yourexpectations and requirements. This holds true to almost anything you do in life.
   - Availability (also known as service availability) is a commonly used metric to quantitatively measure reliability. i did not think about it that way.
3. What new facts did you learn from this section?
   - the mean time between failures (MTBF) is equal to the total time in service divided by the number of failures.
4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
   - no questions come to mind

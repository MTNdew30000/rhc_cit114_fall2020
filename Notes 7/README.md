1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
   - Reading through the chapter it go into detail on Storage, what types of storage, Disaster Recovery and technology, storage for Enterprise, the Cloud, encrypting storage, data backups, and backup locations. They also talk about AWS storage services, S3, S3 Glacier, Elastic File system, Elastic Block store.   
2. Identify quotes that were made, that you found interesting.
   - Amazon S3 Glacier automatically encrypts data at rest using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit symmetric keys and supports secure transfer of your data over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This is good since you would always like to know that your data is always being encrypted.
   - Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) It is built to scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, so your applications have the storage they need – when they need it. It is important to be able to grown when needed so we can minimize the down time it would take to launch a new instance.

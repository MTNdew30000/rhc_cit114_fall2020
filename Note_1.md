### Note 1: Cloud Concept Overview

1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
  -Reading through the chapter it goes over What is IT(Information Technology), and why it is important. We go quickly brush over the differences in Hardware and Software. We talk about The four Pillars of the IT framework. Infrastructure, Development, Security, and Data. They mention Job roles and occupations, and begin to go in depth to talk about Hardware terminology.
2. Identify quotes that were made, that you found interesting.
  -Job Roles & Occupations, specifically on how diverse people can become in the field of IT.
  -focusing on the infrastructure aspects of cloud computing, and some focus on development, security, and data.
3. What new facts did you learn from this section?
  -I was glad to see the job roles and occupations and where they stand on annual pay, with the entry education level.
  -The four Pillars were new to me since I just knew that the cloud were still computers just located in a remote area, and did not know that there were steps to properly set up and deploy them to be used by you or your team/others.
4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
  -For This section not so much since I have a good Foundation on IT, hopefully as the semester progresses I will have the need to ask some questions.

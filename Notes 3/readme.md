1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
   - Reading through the chapter it goes over Global Infrastructure on DevOps. They go into detail on the collaboration between Development and IT operation work to improve teams to build, test, and deploy software faster. As we read along we discover the importance of leadership, and how it that affects the DevOps changes. They help by removing that Silos of software deveploment to create a smooth and fast enviorment to work as a team. Along with analyzing there team on how they communicate so they can think about there problems objectivly. Teams in that practice DevOps are practicing "Us" not "We and Them".
2. Identify quotes that were made, that you found interesting.
   - Devops is a cultural movement that changes how individuals think about their work, values the diversity of work done, supports intentional processes that accelerate the rate by which businesses realize value, and measures the effect of social and technical change. It is a way of thinking and a way of working that enables individuals and organizations to develop and maintain sustainable work practices. It is a cultural framework for sharing stories and developing empathy, enabling people and teams to practice their crafts in effective and lasting ways.
   - Patrick Debois has said that devops is a human problem, implying that every organization will have a devops culture that is unique to the humans within it. While there is no one “true” way of doing devops that will be identical for every organization, we have identified four common themes that any team or organization looking to implement devops will need to spend time and resources on.
3. What new facts did you learn from this section?
   - Silos, I did not know that exited in one point of software development.
   - Also allowing other team mates have to suffer to figure out what is wrong even tho they are a team. 
4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
   - For This section not so much since I have a good Foundation on IT, hopefully as the semester progresses I will have the need to ask some questions.

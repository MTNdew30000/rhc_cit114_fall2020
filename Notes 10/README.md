1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
   - Reading through the chapter it go into detail on scaling and monitoring. When it comes to scaling they talk about how easy it is if you need a more powerful computer for a faster application. It's a quick change just like moving a slider to select what you want from anywhere you want phone or tablet. Monitoring on the other hand closely over looks your application on carefully add or removes resources based on demand.  
2. Identify quotes that were made, that you found interesting.
   - you can add your own third-party monitoring solution’s monitoring agent to your EC2 instances. You don’t have to use CloudWatch; you might have specific needs and requirements that CloudWatch can’t match. I thought if you used AWS services you used mostly there suit of tools, since there is not a lot of documentation on third party monitoring solutions.
   - When deciding what to monitor, the best suggestion is to keep it simple when first starting. If you make it too complicated in the beginning, you’ll probably give up. It is easier for you to start small and grow.
3. What new facts did you learn from this section?
   - The first 5 GB of CloudWatch log data storage is free; additional storage will be charged.
4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
   - no questions come to mind
